# Backend Task - KABI, Abdelaziz Al. Tally

## Develeopmet
* This application can be run using npm
* Just run `npm run start` from the terminal

## Tests
* To run the tests, all you have to do is run `npm run test`

## Review
* I noticed a mistake in the second example of the task, where the total was said to be $35.00, but should've been $45.00
    * 1/1/2022 – 2/1/2022 (2days) => $5.00 X 2 => $10.00
    * 3/1/2022 – 12/1/2022 (10days) => $3.00 X 10 => $30.00
    * 13/1/2022 – 13/1/2022 (1day) => $5.00 X 1 => $5.00
    * The total price for the whole period will be: `$35.00` <- This was the mistake
* To make reviewing this task easier, i have included both test cases that were included in the task, I also added these in the tests
